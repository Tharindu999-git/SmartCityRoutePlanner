# 🏙️ Smart City Route Planner

A **Java console application** developed for the **CIT300 – Data Structures** module.  
This project models a city's transport network using **graphs**, **trees**, and **queues**, demonstrating how data structures can be applied to solve real-world problems such as route planning and connection management.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a **graph-based console system** that can:
- Represent city locations and roads using an adjacency list.
- Add and remove locations or roads dynamically.
- Display all existing connections between locations.
- Use **queues** or **stacks** for route traversal (e.g., BFS).
- Demonstrate the use of **tree structures (AVL Trees)** to organize and manage data efficiently.
